# Simple Configurable Inserters
A Factorio mod that adds simple configuration options to inserters.p
Allows 90° dropoff, extending arm length and choosing dropoff lane.\
A standalone part of the Delta [Δ] Overhaul.

## Why?
Other mods allowed 45° or other angles, extending arms more than base game long inserters reach of 2 tiles, and other abstract settings.\
This mod is aimed for more balanced options by making the arm's legth constant during operation and locking the pickup angle to be directly behing the inserter.

# What does it do?
Inserters can be configured via their GUI or using keybinds while hovering on them.
They also work with built in mirror functions.\

The GUI can be disabled in the Per player Settings tab.

## Inserter's arm length
Default keybind: [L]\
Long-Handed Inserters become obsolote with their functionality built into other inserters. Just like Filter Insterters in 2.0!\
By default their recipe will become hidden, leaving only the other inserters. [It can be changed in the Startup Settings]\

## Dropoff target lane
Default keybind: [Shift + L]\
Works exactly like Krastorio 2's Drop Lane function.\
It allows inserters to place items on belt's closer lane.\

## Turning inserter angles
Default keybind: [Ctrl + R] and [Ctrl + Shift + R]\
Allows inserters to place items on their left or right. Removing the limitation of only forward movement of items.\
Allows for more compact builds. Spaghetti and meatballs, anyone?\

## Blacklist
Inserters can be blacklisted from using either the Length or Direction configuration using Map Settings.
